# The Solar System With HTML and CSS

This project stems from me teaching my 4-year-old daughter about our solar system.

I wanted to showcase the following:

- All planets go around the sun.
- We have four terrestial planets and four gas giants.
- That we have dwarf planets beyond our 8.
- Common things we associate the planets with appropriate for a pre-schooler.
